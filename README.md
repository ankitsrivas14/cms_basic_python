Course Management System - Basic Application in Python

This basic application in python is useful for creators that make a lot of courses and videos. At times, it becomes unmanageable to keep the record in Excel sheets. So with this application, all the data is stored in the database and can be accessed easily.
As the data is persistent, a database is required. 

This little app comes with Command Line Utility: 
-> Press 1 to insert a new course. 
-> Press 2 to show all courses. 
-> Press 3 to delete a course.

I've used Object-Oriented Programming in Python to develop this basic one file application. A lot more functionalities can be added to this application.
